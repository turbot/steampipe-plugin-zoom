# Zoom + Steampipe

[Steampipe](https://steampipe.io) is an open source CLI to instantly query cloud APIs using SQL.

[Zoom](https://zoom.us) provides videotelephony and online chat services through a cloud-based peer-to-peer software platform and is used for teleconferencing, telecommuting, distance education, and social relations.

List your Zoom users:

```sql
select
  email,
  personal_meeting_url
from
  zoom_user;
```

```

| Resolution  | 1. Credentials explicitly set in a Steampipe config file (`~/.steampipe/config/zoom.spc`)<br />2. Credentials specified in environment variables, e.g., `ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID`, `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID` and `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`. |

### Configuration

Installing the latest zoom plugin will create a config file (`~/.steampipe/config/zoom.spc`) with a single connection named `zoom`:

Configure your account details in `~/.steampipe/config/zoom.spc`:

```hcl
connection "zoom" {
  plugin = "zoom"

  # Zoom API credentials are available to users with Developer role in the account.
  # You need to create a Server-to-Server OAuth app (https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/create) or a SDK/JWT APP (https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides/build/sdk-app) to get the credentials.
  # It is recommended that you create Server-to-Server OAuth since the JWT app has been deprecated as of June 1, 2023 and will be disabled on September 1, 2023. https://developers.zoom.us/docs/internal-apps/jwt-faq/

  # Server-to-Server OAuth app credentials

  # Zoom account ID is required for requests. Required. 
  # This can also be set via the ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID environment variable.
  # account_id = "Xt1aUD4WQ56w7hDhVbtDp"

  # Zoom Client ID provided by Server-to-Server OAuth app is required for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the ZOOM_CLIENT_ID environment variable.
  # client_id = "MZw2piRfTsOdpwx2Dh5U"

  # Zoom Client Secret provided by Server-to-Server OAuth app is required for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET environment variable.
  # client_secret = "04tKwHgFGvwB1M4HPHOBFP0aLHYqUE"

  # SDK/JWT app credentials

  # Zoom API key provided by SDK/JWT OAuth app is required for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the ZOOM_API_KEY environment variable.
  # api_key = "LFMU3oagTjO8_5sYKQVe"

  # Zoom API secret provided by SDK/JWT OAuth app is required for requests. Required.
  # This can also be set via the ZOOM_API_SECRET environment variable.
  # api_secret = "PKS96L69nWSFK2y0A07R2k7xGryVbcWiem"

  # If you define Server-to-Server and JWT, then the plugin prioritizes Server-to-Server creds.
}
```

## Configuring Zoom Credentials

### Server-to-Server OAuth Application

You may specify the account ID, client ID, and client secret to authenticate:

- `account_id`: The Zoom account ID.
- `client_id`: The Zoom Client ID provided by Server-to-Server OAuth app.
- `client_secret`: The Zoom Client Secret provided by Server-to-Server OAuth app.

```hcl
connection "zoom" {
  plugin        = "zoom"
  account_id    = "Xt1aUD4WQ56w7hDhVbtDp"
  client_id     = "MZw2piRfTsOdpwx2Dh5U"
  client_secret = "04tKwHgFGvwB1M4HPHOBFP0aLHYqUE"
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use the Zoom environment variable to obtain credentials **only if the `account_id`, `client_id`, and `client_secret` arguments are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID="Xt1aUD4WQ56w7hDhVbtDp"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_ID="MZw2piRfTsOdpwx2Dh5U"
export ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET="04tKwHgFGvwB1M4HPHOBFP0aLHYqUE"
```

### JWT Application

Note: JWT applications are deprecated as of June 1, 2023 and will be entirely disabled on September 1, 2023. We recommend migrating to Server-to-Server OAuth applications.

You may specify the API key and API secret:

- `api_key`: The Zoom API key provided by SDK/JWT OAuth app.
- `api_secret`: The Zoom API secret provided by SDK/JWT OAuth app.

```hcl
connection "zoom" {
  plugin     = "zoom"
  api_key    = "9m_kAcfuTlW_JCrvoMYK6g"
  api_secret = "lEEDVf3SgyQWckN3ASqMpXWpCixkwMzgnZY7"
}
```

Alternatively, you can also use the Zoom environment variable to obtain credentials **only if `api_key` and `api_secret` arguments are not specified** in the connection:

```sh
export ZOOM_API_KEY="9m_kAcfuTlW_JCrvoMYK6g"
export ZOOM_API_SECRET="lEEDVf3SgyQWckN3ASqMpXWpCixkwMzgnZY7"
```
